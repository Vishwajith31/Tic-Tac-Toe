## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This project provides a web-based implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe, allowing players to enjoy the game directly in their web browser.

## Features

- Dynamic player turn display
- Real-time game board updates
- Ability to reset the game and play again

   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage
